# AI Workflow Automation Platform - Dependencies

# Core Python dependencies (no external packages required for demo)
# The demo.py script uses only Python standard library modules:
# - argparse (CLI argument parsing)
# - sys (system operations)
# - time (timing and delays)
# - typing (type hints)
# - random (randomization, currently imported but not used)

# For production deployment, you would add:
# openai>=1.0.0          # OpenAI GPT integration
# anthropic>=0.7.0       # Anthropic Claude integration
# psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0 # PostgreSQL database
# redis>=5.0.0           # Redis caching
# pydantic>=2.0.0        # Data validation
# fastapi>=0.104.0       # API framework
# uvicorn>=0.24.0        # ASGI server
# Note: asyncio is part of Python 3.7+ standard library, no separate installation needed

# Note: The demo script is self-contained and requires Python 3.8+ only
